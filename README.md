# fcc-go
This project is an attempt to recreate all of the freeCodeCamp Back End projects in "pure" Go (i.e., without using a framework).

The freeCodeCamp Back End projects are as follows:
1. [Timestamp Microservice](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/back-end-development-and-apis-projects/timestamp-microservice)
2. [Request Header Parser Microservice](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/back-end-development-and-apis-projects/request-header-parser-microservice)
3. [URL Shortener Microservice](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/back-end-development-and-apis-projects/url-shortener-microservice)
4. [Exercise Tracker](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/back-end-development-and-apis-projects/exercise-tracker)
5. [File Metadata Microservice](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/back-end-development-and-apis-projects/file-metadata-microservice)

Please note that, since all of these microservices are bundled together into one app in this project, 
some URIs had to be changed, so the services will not work in exactly the same way as the freeCodeCamp automated grader would expect.
